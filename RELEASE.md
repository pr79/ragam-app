# Ragam App Baseline Version

**Version Code:** `🔥 Baseline_v2.0_Stable`
**Description:** Official Stable Release for Hugging Face Spaces & Local Windows.
**Status:** Pristine code with no experimental iOS routing or Beta hacks. Stable UI with full Raga database capabilities.

### Contents of this stable release:
- Native `st.audio()` elements for all media wrappers.
- Modern Suno-style CSS interface.
- 72 Melakarta Raga dictionary + Janya ragas.
- Safe `os.path` and FFmpeg dependency routing for portable Windows scaling (`imageio-ffmpeg` bypassing Debian apt-get).
- Decoupled Session State architecture that preserves audio players during parallel backend analysis.
